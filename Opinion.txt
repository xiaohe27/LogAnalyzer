There is no need to use HashMap to store the list of events into
a db in parsing phase, and unzip the db ast to a list of events and
then invoke the event methods!

Just save (maybe no need to save at all, each time a event is parsed,
we can discard it or use its data to call the monitoring method) to a list.
