There is no need to use HashMap to store the list of events into
a db in parsing phase, and unzip the db ast to a list of events and
then invoke the event methods!

Just save (maybe no need to save at all, each time a event is parsed,
we can discard it or use its data to call the monitoring method) to a list.

Idea:
Provide two modes:
1) fast but unchecked mode (no regex is used)
2) checked mode (use regex to read data)


***********************
Monpoly allows optional white spaces in between event names and event args (tuples)
