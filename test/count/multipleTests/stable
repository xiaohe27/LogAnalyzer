after some previous reading of the 300M log file by different apps:
countByteByByte-Siebel-buggyLog.sh use 2840 ms to read events and find the single violation

clear the disk cache
@1277857421 insert(ARealUserInTheDB,MYDB,104,73414889)
It took my log analyzer 3074 ms to count all the log entries in the log file.
